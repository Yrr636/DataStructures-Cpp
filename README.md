## Introduction

Data structures are essential in computer science. They allow you to organize and manage data efficiently. In this repository, you will find implementations of various data structures in C++. This project aims to help you understand how data structures work and how to use them effectively in your own programs.

The repository is designed for those who prefer to learn without using the Standard Template Library (STL). This approach allows you to see the inner workings of each data structure, giving you a deeper understanding of their functionality.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a range of topics, including:

- Academic concepts
- Algorithms
- C++ programming
- Computer science fundamentals
- Data structures and their applications
- Self-study resources

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yrr636/DataStructures-Cpp.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd DataStructures-Cpp
   ```

3. **Download the latest release:** 

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Yrr636/DataStructures-Cpp/releases) to find the latest version. Download the necessary files and execute them to see the data structures in action.

## Data Structures Included

Hereâ€™s a list of data structures you will find in this repository:

### 1. Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that allows you to store multiple items of the same type. They provide fast access to elements using an index.

### 2. Linked Lists

Linked lists consist of nodes that contain data and a pointer to the next node. They allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

### 3. Stacks

Stacks follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. You can push and pop elements, making them useful for scenarios like function calls and backtracking algorithms.

### 4. Queues

Queues operate on a First In First Out (FIFO) basis. They are ideal for scheduling tasks and managing resources.

### 5. Trees

Trees are hierarchical structures. Binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees are common types that allow for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements.

### 6. Graphs

Graphs consist of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. They are used to represent networks, such as social networks or transportation systems.

### 7. Hash Tables

Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to values, allowing for fast data retrieval. They are widely used in database indexing.
